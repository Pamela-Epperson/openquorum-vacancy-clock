//
// ─── SCRAPER_CONTRACT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A future GitHub Actions / serverless scraper populates scaffolded states by
// writing board rows into `boards:[]` and flipping `status` to "live".
// EVERY board row written by the scraper (and every existing row) MUST match
// this exact JSON shape:
//
//   {
//     id: 1201,                       // number — unique across the whole file (state gets a hundreds range)
//     name: "Board name",             // string — official board/commission name, verbatim from source
//     domain: "health",               // one of: health|education|equity|environment|housing|disability|justice
//     totalSeats: 15,                 // number — authorized seats per statute/portal
//     vacantSeats: 4,                 // number — currently vacant seats
//     vacantSince: "2026-01-15",      // ISO date — earliest current vacancy date, from source; null if unpublished
//     authority: "Governor",          // string — appointing authority as stated by source
//     constituent: "Who this serves", // string — population served
//     applyUrl: "https://…",          // string — application URL (usually the state-level applyUrl)
//     sourceUrl: "https://…",         // string — REQUIRED. Exact page the row was scraped from
//     lastVerified: "2026-07-07"      // ISO date — REQUIRED. When the scraper last confirmed this row
//   }
//
// Optional per-row fields used by specific tools (carried on seed rows):
//   mandate (string), requires (string[]), confirmation (bool), criticalNote (string)
//
// The scraper also stamps the state-level `scraper` object:
//   scraper: { endpoint:"<scrape URL>", lastPulled:"<ISO datetime>", selectorProfile:"<parser id>" }
//
// Integrity rule ("Prove It"): every row carries sourceUrl + lastVerified.
// Estimates must be labeled as estimates in the UI. Never invent vacancy dates,
// seat counts, or names. Accuracy outranks completeness.
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Factory for states awaiting scraper coverage — no fabricated data, empty boards.
// applyUrl/applyAuthority are null until verified per state (TODO verify per state
// as each scraper comes online).
